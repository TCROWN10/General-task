    <strong><h1> WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW !!!</h1></strong>
    <h1> Greatness may be attributed to those who exhibit strong leadership qualities, inspire others,
         and have a clear vision for positive change.
         The greatness of a person is sometimes measured by their adherence to 
         ethical and moral principles, 
         as well as their commitment to justice, fairness, and compassion.</h1>
